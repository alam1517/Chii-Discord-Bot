# Chii-Discord-Bot
My personal python Discord bot.

It uses [Youtube APIs](https://pypi.org/project/youtube_dl/) to download and play audio from Youtube.

### What can it do so far?
* Welcome new members to the server
* React and respond back to certain strings in chat
* Probability commands
* Play music using Youtube links

### Commands (prefix "-")
Command Name | Description
-------------|------------
coinflip | Flips a coin
rolldice | Rolls a dice
choose | Chooses a number between n and m (n and m are user's argument values)
play | Play music using, so far, Youtube links
exit | Exit the bot from voice channel
pause | Pauses the music the bot is currently playing
resume | Resumes the music from bot if it is paused
stop | Stops the music the bot is playing

### TODOs
- [ ] React to certain string messages
- [ ] Add game command where users could interact with it
- [ ] Add a GitHub webhook
- [ ] Add other APIs to it (Spotify, Weather, image-based, etc.)
- [ ] Host it in the cloud (using [repl.it](https://repl.it))
