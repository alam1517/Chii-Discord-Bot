# Chii Discord Bot

Chii is a personal Discord bot that is in continuous development. It uses [Discord](https://github.com/discord/discord-api-docs), [Youtube](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl), & [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/current) APIs.

Invite Chii to your server [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=788205742188003368&permissions=8&scope=bot)!

## üîß Features
* Welcome new members to the server via direct message
* Respond back to certain messages
* React to certain messages
* Display guild/server information
* Simple probability/chance
* Play audio (Youtube)
* Display the weather for a city

## ‚öô Setup/Installation
You can invite Chii to your server using this [link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=788205742188003368&permissions=8&scope=bot)!
Alternatively, you can clone this repo and host it yourself:
```
git clone https://github.com/alam1517/Chii-Discord-Bot.git
```
Before starting, making sure that you have latest version of python3 and python3-pip.
To check, do the following:
```
python3 --version
pip --version
```
If you do not have either or both installed, do the following:
```
sudo apt-get install python3
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
```
Afterwards, you will need to install the other libraries/APIs if you do not have it:
```
pip install -U discord.py

pip install -U youtube_dl
```

## ‚úî TODOs
Chii is still in development and will be adding new features/updates at an upcoming time.
Below are ideas that I would like to implement:
- [x] React to certain string messages
- [ ] Add game command where users could interact with it
- [ ] Add other APIs to it:
  - [ ] Spotify
  - [x] Weather
  - [ ] Image-based
- [ ] Host it in the cloud (using [repl.it](https://repl.it) or some other alternative) or locally (using raspberry pi)
- [ ] Organize the project more (seperate certain functions into different file)
- [x] Add server info command to show info of current server

And more will be added.
